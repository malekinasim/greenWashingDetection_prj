**Greenwashing Detection Model**

### **Introduction**
Greenwashing refers to deceptive marketing strategies where companies exaggerate or misrepresent their environmental efforts. This model aims to detect potential greenwashing by analyzing image colors, particularly focusing on green hues, brightness, contrast, and color distribution.

### **Methodology**
To improve the accuracy of greenwashing detection, we analyze only the **green regions** in the image rather than the entire image. The key steps include:

#### **1. Identifying Green Regions**
To extract only the green areas from an image, we use the **HSV color space**:
```python
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
lower_green = np.array([35, 40, 40])  # Lower threshold for green
upper_green = np.array([85, 255, 255])  # Upper threshold for green
mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_green, upper_green)
```
This mask isolates green-colored pixels for further analysis.

#### **2. Calculating Brightness in Green Regions**
Brightness is measured using the **V channel** of the HSV model:
```python
v_channel = hsv[:, :, 2]
green_brightness = np.mean(v_channel[mask > 0])
```
This ensures we measure brightness only in the **green** regions, avoiding interference from other colors.

#### **3. Measuring Contrast in Green Regions**
Contrast is evaluated by calculating the **standard deviation** of the grayscale version of the image, only within green regions:
```python
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
green_contrast = np.std(gray[mask > 0])
```
A high standard deviation indicates higher contrast.

#### **4. Analyzing Other Colors (Red & Blue)**
To detect potential manipulation, we also measure the proportion of **red and blue** in the image:
```python
lower_red = np.array([0, 50, 50])
upper_red = np.array([10, 255, 255])
red_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_red, upper_red)
red_percentage = np.count_nonzero(red_mask) / (image.shape[0] * image.shape[1])

lower_blue = np.array([100, 50, 50])
upper_blue = np.array([140, 255, 255])
blue_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_blue, upper_blue)
blue_percentage = np.count_nonzero(blue_mask) / (image.shape[0] * image.shape[1])
```
High red and blue content could indicate that the image is not purely eco-friendly but might be artificially balanced.

#### **5. Final Greenwashing Score Calculation**
To determine the likelihood of greenwashing, we combine the measured parameters:
```python
score = (green_percentage * 1.5) + (green_contrast * 0.8) 
- (blue_percentage * 0.7) - (red_percentage * 1.2) 
+ (green_brightness * 0.5)
```
This equation accounts for the weight of each factor in influencing the perception of an eco-friendly image.

### **Conclusion**
✔ This model effectively detects greenwashing by focusing on **green areas**, rather than analyzing the entire image.
✔ Adjusting **brightness and contrast thresholds** ensures a more **accurate** representation of artificially enhanced images.
✔ Future improvements may include machine learning models for deeper image analysis.
